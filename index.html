            <p class="lead">We love expressing ourselves on the Internet. We love how convenient it is to shop, bank, and share information online. We love sending and receiving messages and sharing photos and art with the world. What we don't love? Criminals looking to steal our data, and destroy our lives.</p>

              <li>Team CyberLock is passionate about helping people understand and prepare for cyber threat. We are a group of four MBA students at Kellogg School of Management, enrolled in New Venture Discovery with Stef Farsht. Our cumulative experience includes strategy and management consulting, product management, and product marketing at BCG, Deloitte Consulting, Microsoft, Google, and Dell EMC.</li>
              <li>Currently we are interested in exploring "personal secury hygeine"; e.g. Do we know where we store and share our data? What data are we willing to share, when, and why? What strategies do we have in place for when things go wrong?

          <h2>Cyber risk is a problem because...</h2>
          <p class="my-text-primary">
            We ALL lack an understanding of how to protect our own data on the Internet. Every one of us has murky ideas about how to secure our identity, data, and finances in an online environment. All of us hear about high-profile data breaches, have friends and family whose credit card numbers have been stolen, or have heard about celebrities whose private photos are blasted all over the Internet by hackers. What should we do about it? None of us are sure.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <h2>This is a real problem because....</h2>
          <p class="my-text-primary">Identity theft and fraud costs us over $16B a year*. Not to mention increasing anxiety and even depression! Yet, the personal consequences of a cyberattack are unclear to most of us. We buckle our seatbelts because we have seen what happens to crash test dummies; we don't take precautions even after a big, public data breach because, we don't exactly know what will happen otherwise. "So what?" attitudes perpetuate the problem.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <h2>We are motivated to solve it because...</h2>
          <p class="my-text-primary">YIKES! We hate feeling helpless and vulnerable. We have loved ones who must spend hours fighting fraud resulting from stolen Social Security numbers, and friends who post everything to social media with little regard to how their information could be weaponized. We see the consequences of unchecked cyber risk that strikes us at the most critical moments of our lives.

          <p class="my-text-primary">Throughout the quarter, our intrepid team will be collecting ethnographic data, conducting customer interviews and focus groups, speaking with subject matter experts, and prototyping potential solutions. We are determined to find an alternative to the status quo.</p>

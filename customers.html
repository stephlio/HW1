        <p class="my-text-primary">We describe our hypothetical customers in detail, their name and age, were they live, their educational level, if they are married or divorced, their preferences towards buying our products and services, how skilled they are in using a computer, their aspirations, etc. By doing so, we are able to focus our development process on the exact goals and needs of our customers -- using the power of empathy, personal experience and relationships through narrative and story telling. We collected insights from countless customer interviews and began clustering them to discover patterns, validating (or challenging) our customer archetypes below. Design thinking is the basis behind our customer profiles.</p>

          <h3>Archetype 1: Happy-Go-Luck Hector</h3>
          <img class="img-responsive img-circle" src="https://blog.oncallinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/millenniel-man-1024x682.jpg" alt="Responsive image" title="Hector" style="display: inline" height=200px>
          <p class="my-text-primary italic"> Hector is a 23-year-old male and recent college graduate, lives in Brooklyn and works as a manager at Zara SoHo. He makes $75,000 a year and spends nearly all his money on rent and discounted Zara clothing. His aspiration is to make enough money in fashion partnerships that he can quit his full-time job.
          </p>
          <ul class="my-text-primary">
            <li>He is constantly looking for an outlet to charge his phone. Hector is very proud of his social media following on Instagram, where he has a popular men’s style account. He broadcasts every single meal and outfit to Snapchat, and he loves getting feedback and admiration from his followers.
            </li>
            <li>Hector is the youngest of three children; his parents and two siblings live in Austin, TX. He moved away for college and is in love with “big city life.”
            </li>

          <p class="my-text-primary thick">Potential Purchase Occasions and Drivers:</p>
          <ul class="my-text-primary">
            <li>High-profile hacking and stalking cases featuring celebrities and other bloggers do catch his attention; as a wanna-be public figure, he thinks this could be a concern down the road.
            </li>
            <li>He has never been concerned about his own online safety/privacy; however, his older sister once told him to take down a post where he photographed his open Passport. If friends and family are uncomfortable by his constant posting, he tries to respect their wishes.
            </li>

          <h3>Archetype 2: Type-A Tanya</h3>
          <img class="img-responsive img-circle" src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/article_small/public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/20/15/successful-working-woman.jpg" alt="Responsive image" title="Tanya" style="display: inline" height=200px>
          <p class="my-text-primary italic">Tanya just turned “flirty 30” and is a go-getter. She is an ambitious manager at McKinsey making $170,000 based out of Washington D.C. She just purchased a  2BR apartment on Capitol Hill with a serious boyfriend of ten years who works at a law firm.
            <ul class="my-text-primary">
              <li>She is proud of her academic and professional achievements, and is actively looking to build her LinkedIn presence as a thought leader. Every day, she listens to NPR and reads the Washington Post for interesting tidbits to tell her clients and team. She’s a bit of a know-it-all but her friends love that she is always eager to do the right thing.
              </li>
              <li>She is confident in her ability to learn anything; she frequently takes bootcamp courses to learn how to code and speak Arabic. Outside of work, she is training to become a certified Pure Barre instructor and volunteers to help refugees.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="my-text-primary thick">Potential Purchase Occasions and Drivers:</p>
            <ul class="my-text-primary">
              <li>People come to Tanya for advice because she “always knows just what to do.” She is concerned about newsworthy breaches like Target and Equifax, but doesn’t know where to go for information. She likes having a protocol for everything (she was the class monitor for fire drills in elementary school) and hates that she is clueless every time a new data breach happens.
              </li>

          <h3>Archetype 3: Jaded Janet</h3>
          <img class="img-responsive img-circle" src="http://image1.masterfile.com/getImage/NjExNy0wODIxOTgwMWVuLjAwMDAwMDAw=AIbEXT/6117-08219801en_Masterfile.jpg" alt="Responsive image" title="Janet" style="display: inline" height=200px>
          <p class="my-text-primary italic">Janet is a 52-year-old nurse practitioner and owns a 4BR home in the Chicago suburbs with her husband, a realtor. They make $350,000 a year in combined income and are saving most of it toward their retirement in 15 years. She has a close relationship with her only daughter,  a college freshman at Northwestern University.
          </p>
          <ul class="my-text-primary">
            <li>Janet has a Facebook account to share photos with friends and family, but is nervous about how much her daughter shares on Twitter and Instagram. She “Googles” herself every 6 months to see what information might be online.
            </li>
            <li>Janet listens to CNN every night and feels overwhelmed by the bad news; she prefers to throw herself into offline activities like gardening and book club. She competes in her neighborhood’s annual “Best Lawn” competition. Her favorite recent book is Hillary Clinton’s “What Happened.”</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="my-text-primary thick">Potential Purchase Occasions and Drivers:</p>
          <ul class="my-text-primary">
            <li>Janet hears about high-profile breaches like Equifax on the news and feels overwhelmed. She tries to be proactive, but doesn’t know how to navigate conflicting advice or if there is further action she can take.
            </li>
            <li>Janet orders credit reports every year to make sure she is not a victim of fraud and has filed an identity theft report with her local police in the past; she’s tired of having to freeze her credit every few years.
            </li>
